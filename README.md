# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project we're helping a top travel technology company, called PlanMyTrip, with collecting and presenting data for customers via the search page.  PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences. We will be using Jupyter Notebook, GMaps, Google places API to help travelers find the ideal vacation spot!


### Resources
- Data Sources: cities.csv, worldcities.csv, WeatherPy_vacation.csv, WeatherPy_Database.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Anaconda 4.8.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3, GMaps, Google Places API, OpenWeatherMap API

##Results
The analysis of the initial weather data shows the following:
- For cities closer to the equator, 0Â° latitude, the temperatures become warmer and cities further from the equator the temperatures become cooler. Refer to [City Latitude vs. Max Temperature](Fig1.png) for data supporting this.
- The percentage humidity in each cities are unpredictable due to changing weather patterns that can increase or decrease percent humidity. Refer to [City Latitude vs. Humidity](Fig2.png) for data supporting this.
- Cloudiness is unpredictable due to changing weather patterns that can increase or decrease percent cloudiness. Refer to [City Latitude vs. Cloudiness(%)](Fig3.png) for data supporting this.
- wind speed is unpredictable due to changing weather patterns that can increase or decrease wind speed. Refer to [City Latitude vs. Wind Speed](Fig4.png) for data supporting this.
